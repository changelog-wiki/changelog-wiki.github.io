## Why does this exist?
I think that changelogs are important for a few reasons:
* They tell the user why they should update, as a software developer you spend countless hours working on a product, you should want users to see the fruits of your labor.
* If the update contains security patches its important that users know about this, and without knowing they may not update leaving them vulnerable.
* Changelogs build user trust in your software, users are able to see specifically what you have been working on and the more transparent you are with them the easier it is for a user to understand *why* they should trust your software.

## Hey [software name] isn't included here!
Sorry, but currently this is a one man project. If you want you can open an issue [here](https://github.com/changelog-wiki/changelog-wiki.github.io) and I would be happy to take a look.
